# 8-bit-Standalone-CPU
  This is a full project bundle that help you to learn all the internal working of a cpu from scratch. This project takes you from an absolute beginner to expert level by handling real time exceptiona and anomalies. we go through the design , working , and implementation of each module separately. Once the cpu is completed we will interface an 1602 lcd and put some text on it as a success celebration of the project. The projects gives deep insights into the inner working , bus archtecture , timing and hirearchy of a microprocessor which inturn teaches us how a computer works in its core. we also design the assembly language , instruction set etc all by ourself

we use an arduino nano as a programmer to upload assembly language our cpu
